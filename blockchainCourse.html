                            explores the concept, need, importance and future of digital identity. Digital identity is
                            the core of digital transaction. Knowledge of exactly who or what we are dealing with is a
                            prerequisite of all communication and transaction. In digital transactions, it is essential
                            for a legal entity to prove its own identity and verify those of other parties. Digital
                            identity is needed to assign ownership to a digital asset. The course will first discuss and
                            compare the various approaches to create digital identity. It will then scrutinize the
                            challenges of creating, deploying and servicing digital identity and investigate the impact
                            of personal data privacy regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation
                            (GDPR) for blockchain. Finally, the course will give introduce the new approach to digital
                            identity; that of Self Sovereign Identity or User-Centric Verifiable Digital Credential
                            where portable secure digital credentials (self-sovereign identity) solution held by
                            individuals can be independently, cryptographically and rapidly verified using emerging
                            blockchain standards and an approach that may give rise to a global digital verification

                            cannot be replicated and maintain their integrity to hold value, and preserve transfer
                            value. It then discusses why asset tokenization is essential to powering the next-generation
                            digital economy and paving the way for new business models that are built on the “instance

                            and trade finance industries. Each of the lecturers will examine using real use cases on how
                            blockchain solutions are employed to tackle industry problems and address pain points
                            arising from business processes. The pros and cons of using blockchain vs other
                            technologies, the challenges and risks of using blockchain and best practices for long-term
                            success will also be addressed. The necessary financial background will be provided by the
                            lecturers so students participating in this course need not have any prior knowledge in
                            finance.
